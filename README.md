Created with Flask (Python), this application provides the match report of any match for which detailed data is available on the FotMob site. In addition to important statistics, it is also possible to see the shotmap of the match in this report. It should be noted that the size of the symbols on the shotmap is determined according to the Expected Goals (xG) value and Expected Goals on Target (xGOT) value. 

Here is an example:
